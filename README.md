# Airbnb Listing Price Forecasting

## Modeling task: 

Airbnb is an online marketplace for accommodation rental founded in 2008. 
Properties hosted on the Airbnb platform are owned by private companies and individuals, who determine the listing rental price themselves.

This repository predicts property prices for Airbnb listings in London using a deep learning neural network architecture.
Preprocess steps include data mining, feature engineering, and implementation of NLP techniques to process both tabular and text data.

## Data:

The dataset includes 55.000 properties containing the listing features (e.g., location, number of rooms, property type).
Additionally, the dataset contains text fields with the listing description, overview, and reviews.
